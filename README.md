# Zapbox / Unity XR Interaction Toolkit Demo
Unity project to demonstrate the Zapbox provider working with Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit.

Build it for iOS on a Mac with Xcode. You'll need to set up the signing configuration to your Apple Developer account in Xcode.

We recommend an iPhone 11 or later with the current version of the provider plugin.
